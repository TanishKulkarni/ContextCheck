# 🧠 ContextCheck — Explainable AI for Misinformation Awareness

ContextCheck is a **GenAI-powered web application** that helps users understand **how news claims and headlines can mislead**, even when they are partially true.  
Instead of labeling content as *fake* or *real*, ContextCheck focuses on **missing context, framing, and potential impact** — encouraging critical thinking.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

In today’s digital world, misinformation rarely looks like an outright lie.

Most misleading content:
- Uses **true statistics without context**
- Relies on **emotional or alarming framing**
- Omits **baselines, sources, or timelines**
- Spreads faster than fact-checks

Binary labels like *fake / real* are often:
- Overly simplistic
- Politically sensitive
- Not educational for users

There is a need for a tool that explains **how** information can mislead — not just **whether** it is wrong.

## ⚙️ How ContextCheck Works

1️⃣ **User Input**  
Users paste a headline, tweet, or news claim into the app.

2️⃣ **GenAI Analysis**  
A Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes the claim to:

- Detect missing or vague context
- Explain why the claim may mislead
- Assess potential real-world impact

3️⃣ **Explainable Output**  
The app returns:
- 🔴🟡🟢 Misinformation risk level  
- 🧩 Clear explanations (not accusations)  
- ✍️ A neutral, context-aware rewrite  
- 📊 Confidence score for transparency  

4️⃣ **User-Friendly Visualization**  
Results are displayed with:
- Animated risk badges  
- Confidence meter  
- Sectioned explanations  
- Copy-to-clipboard support
